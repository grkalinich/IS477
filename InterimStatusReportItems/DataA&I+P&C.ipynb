    "### Dataset 1: ACS\n",
    "In [DatasetsExamples.ipynb](../ProjectPlanItems/DatasetsExamples.ipynb), I have already gathered the codes for the year 2022 manually by looking at the table for that year. We can see the variable codes from using a website formated like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "`https://api.census.gov/data/*YEAR*/acs/acs1/variables.html`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you change the `*YEAR*` with the actual number. This can get tedious, so to speed it up we can do a sort of loop to get all the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**One thing to note before the loop**, is that within these variables they are sectioned by tables. Each variable starts with the table ID which is why in my example from before you saw code like this in the `VARIABLE_CODES` list:\n",
    "\n",
    "`'B15003_001E',  # Total Population 25 Years and Over`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of that code (before the underscore) is the table ID which then is followed by the varaible ID (after the underscore). So using our example from about we have a table ID of B15003 and a variable ID of 001E.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable codes are actually consistent throughout the years, **BUT** the table ID is not. It is somewhat consistent with needing to follow this format:\n",
    "- `B15003` for 2009-2019 and 2021-2022\n",
    "- `B15002` for 2005-2008\n",
    "\n",
    "The table codes have a major difference in that while they have the same data, the `B15002` is split between male and female variable codes. In those years I will just combine them to achieve the same effect of `B15003` which is combined already*. This doesn't change the looping functionality too much as all I will be doing is just checking the year and using the appropriate codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that 2020 was not included above. This is because of the pandemic. On their [website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2020/1-year.html) they say, \"\\[t]he Census Bureau did not release its standard 2020 ACS 1-year estimates because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the Census Bureau released experimental estimates from the 1-year data.  They are posted on the 2020 ACS 1-Year Experimental Data Release page. They will not be released on data.census.gov.\" While I could use this experimental data, I had to download it as an xlsx file shown here:\n",

    "\n",
    "With the amount of data we have, I am choosing to remove this year. I could choose to use acs5 instead of acs1, but I do not want to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also be using one other library: `time`. This is for a simple sleep command so that with all this looping I do not overload the API. The format of the code will look similar to the examples file with the added changes stated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>*Every year does have the `B15002` table, but to save time I am choosing not to use it for the other years since `B15003` is already made.</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note: the code box below takes about 50-60 seconds to run. You can skip this I have already ran it and created a csv file.***"
